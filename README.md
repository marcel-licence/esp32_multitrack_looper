The latest update has been tested on the ESP32 Audio Kit V2.2 with an ES8388 audio codec.
You can use it stand-alone when applied the analog button mod (https://youtu.be/r0af0DB1R68)
Default configuration:
- Key1: set length
- Key2: toggle click
- Key3 - Key6: toggle rec mode

I recommend using Tera Term or another VT100 compatible tool to see whats going on inside of the application
